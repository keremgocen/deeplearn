[Hinton. 2007. Learning multiple layers of representation.](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tics.pdf) will be implemented on [The minst database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) in 2 parts

Abstract:
"To achieve its impressive performance in tasks such as
speech perception or object recognition, the brain
extracts multiple levels of representation from the sensory
input. Backpropagation was the first computationally
efficient model of how neural networks could learn
multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled
training data and it did not work well in deep networks.
The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be
overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain
top-down connections and training them to generate
sensory data rather than to classify it. Learning
multilayer generative models might seem difficult, but
a recent discovery makes it easy to learn nonlinear
distributed representations one layer at a time."
